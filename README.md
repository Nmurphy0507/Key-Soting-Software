# Key-Soting-Software
This is an project I am doing for a internship through Frostburg State University. It is a website created using HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, SQL. This website main functionality is to safely store all the keys for the dorm rooms on campus to better organize and keep them all in one place.
